# Intermission

Sometimes the solution to a problem will not present itself until you relent and take a break. I have experienced this and was recommended it in CPE 464 by Prof. Hugh Smith. It is invaluable advice.

You brain does not work under pressure. This major and course are both exceptionally good at triggering the flight or fight response in our lizards brains. Thats what happened to me. Solving problems might not even be the hard part. The hard part is learning. Learning under pressure is actually what you have to learn this quarter.

Getting __into__ the "flow" of programming is one of the greatest feelings. However, in calculus terms, it is a local maximum. It is really great, but it is not infinite. You might find these moments of inspiration in other activities as well. Or you might not.

If ever you are stuck, one of the best things you can do is walk away. Take a break. Take a walk. Take a nap. Resume your routine (Have a routine!). Have your regularly scheduled meals. What is important about these is you leave the headspace of programming. Turn it off before you turn it back on later. Accept that the flow is gone or you're not finding it today. Thats fine. Normal.

It is super important to stay on track with assignments this and every other quarter. Starting them as soon as possible means you do have the ability to sleep on a problem before its due. Giving yourself that buffer is like handling yourself cash. So valuable. Of all the people in your life to spoil in such a way, yourself is the easiest choice.

One strat that has been valuable to me as a professional procrastinator is to just start something without any expectation of actual progress. This lets you accumulate baby steps at a task while also normalizing working on it.

After being productive or failing to do so (its ok, it happens), take a break, whether thats 10 minutes or 10 hours. Once you've turned off the programming brain, enage with something else fun, like a game, sport, or puzzle. Turning off the stress reponse to the assignment might be hard. You're worried about the dealine and the problem and the current state of your code (or lack there of). Put in the effort to be in a place where you can take those breaks (Start assignemnts early). Then take them. Accept that there are times when you don't have to focus on the problem.

It's not guarenteed, but in these unfocused times, you might gain a new perspective on your problem. You might just realized where your bug is while eating dinner. You might get some good advice from someone while hanging out with friends. You might go to sleep and just try some more the next day.

This module's homework is to stop and relax for a few minutes. I'll be grading you based on how little you accomplish and how many deep breaths you take.
